Project Purpose and Goal

- to build a fully functioning e-commerce clothing application using react
- to better understand redux, hooks, state management, implementing payments and authentication, routing

Web Stack and Explanation

- creat react app (react), firebase (authentication + security), stripe (payments)

Problems and Thought Process

- issue with sass loader due to version 5 conflict - only version 4 allowed. Had to uninstall and download compatible version.

Lessons Learned

- using react you have to learn to deal with errors, dependency conflicts, and decide what you need and why you need it - effectively.
- must decide on components, decide the State and where it lives, what changes when state changes? How are things connected in the virtual DOM?
- need to make sure the components are nice and simple and make sense to you
